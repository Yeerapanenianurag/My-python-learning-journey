   - **Variables**: Learn how to declare variables and store data.
   - **Data Types**: Explore integers, floats, strings, and booleans.
   - **Type Conversion**: Practice converting between different data types using functions like `int()`, `float()`, `str()`.
   - **Input/Output**: Use `input()` to take user input and `print()` to output results.

---

### 3. **Control Structures**
   - **If-Else Statements**: Learn conditional logic.
   - **Comparison Operators**: Understand operators like `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, etc.
   - **Logical Operators**: Learn `and`, `or`, `not`.
   - **Loops**: Understand `for` and `while` loops for repetition.

---

### 4. **Data Structures**
   - **Lists**: Learn how to create, access, and modify lists.
   - **Tuples**: Understand immutable sequences.
   - **Dictionaries**: Learn how to work with key-value pairs.
   - **Sets**: Understand unique unordered collections of items.

---

### 5. **Functions**
   - **Defining Functions**: Learn how to define reusable code with `def`.
   - **Arguments and Return Values**: Understand how to pass data into functions and return results.
   - **Lambda Functions**: Discover anonymous functions for quick tasks.
   - **Recursion**: Learn the concept of functions calling themselves.

---

### 6. **File Handling**
   - **Opening and Closing Files**: Learn how to work with text and binary files.
   - **Reading and Writing Files**: Master reading from and writing to files.
   - **Working with File Paths**: Understand relative and absolute paths.

---

### 7. **Error Handling**
   - **Exceptions**: Learn how to handle errors gracefully using `try` and `except`.
   - **Custom Exceptions**: Create your own exceptions for specific cases.

---

### 8. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
   - **Classes and Objects**: Understand the concepts of classes and objects.
   - **Attributes and Methods**: Learn how to define and use attributes and methods inside classes.
   - **Inheritance**: Explore how one class can inherit properties from another.
   - **Polymorphism and Encapsulation**: Master advanced OOP concepts like method overriding and data hiding.
